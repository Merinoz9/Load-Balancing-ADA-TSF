The TSF that started as a tool for simulating load balancing and scheduling problems. The project started at the University of Dortmund Germany, our branch has continously added new functionality, such as: distributed information system, workflow scheduling sypport, and energy conservation.  

The project contains the following subdirectories
- doc, contains a document that describes the architecture of the framework
- tools, constains mathlab functions and tools to prepare results
- src, the source of the projects. It contains two mains branches de and mx. de contains core simulation functionality, while mx contains workflow suppor and the hierarchical energy model.
